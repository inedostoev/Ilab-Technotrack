and glumly serves the medicine bottle,
and never played a shrewder trick.
and never stir a foot away!
and sighs, and asks oneself all through:
And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
But God, how deadly dull to sample
but when past joking he fell sick,
he really forced one to admire him
Let others learn from his example!
My uncle -- high ideals inspire him;
of entertaining the half-dead:
one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
sickroom attendance night and day
When will the devil come for you??
