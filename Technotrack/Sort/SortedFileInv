of entertaining the half-dead:
one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
But God, how deadly dull to sample
Let others learn from his example!
and glumly serves the medicine bottle,
And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
and sighs, and asks oneself all through:
and never played a shrewder trick.
but when past joking he fell sick,
he really forced one to admire him
My uncle -- high ideals inspire him;
When will the devil come for you??
sickroom attendance night and day
and never stir a foot away!
